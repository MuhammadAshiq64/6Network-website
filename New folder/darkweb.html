Introduction 
</h1>
<br> 
<p>
The Internet provides a platform for an information system, known as the World Wide Web, where 

information can be exchanged by a global community of citizens. Within this community exists the 
Dark Web or Darknet, an environment that affords its users anonymity, making attribution for 
activities challenging by encrypting and routing users’ traffic via multiple nodes (The Tor Project 
2018). The most popular version of the dark web, The Onion Routing (Tor) network and protocol, has 
become a haven for criminal activity, including sharing illegally-acquired information, trading illicit 
contraband, and recruiting others, all with disregard for borders and legality (Dalins et al. 2018; Vogt 
2017). The dark web became popular with the launch of Silk Road – a drug marketplace – in 2011, and 
also by its demise in 2013 (Van Buskirk et al. 2014). Ever since, the dark web has been notorious for 
facilitating illegal activities and is increasingly being targeted and monitored by authorities.

Discussion of Literature 
</h1>

<br> 
<p>
The dark web is a feature of a specific overlay distributed system existing atop the global internet that 

provides the functionality of remaining untraceable and promises to be a haven from prying eyes, 
mainly law enforcement. Technological improvements have allowed for novel ways to enable the dark 
web to exist and sustain itself longer than before.

<h1>
Markets/Illegal Content 
</h1>

<br> 
<p>
Marketplaces like Silk Road, Hansa and AlphaBay have been popular over the years for allowing trade 

of questionable goods like illicit drugs, weapons, stolen identities, stolen credit card details, child 
pornography, and others. Silk Road was one of the first major such marketplaces reaching sales of over 
USD 1.2 million per month (Christin 2013) mainly consisting of controlled substances and narcotics. 
Weapons are also a popular commodity on such marketplaces but are overshadowed by the sale of 
illicit drugs (Rhumorbarbe et al. 2018). Stolen information is also found for sale on these markets as it 
provides the criminal, and its acquaintances, anonymity. This data can include the sale financial fraud-
related documents, e.g. credit card details or identity theft enabling documents like medical records as 
these typically have a higher shelf life (Hoffman and Rimo 2017).

<h1>
Proxy to Surface Web 
</h1>

<br> 
<p>
Many civilians also use the Tor darknet infrastructure to browse the surface web, or hidden service 

versions of popular websites on the surface web e.g. Facebook (social media), ProPublica (news), 
<u>DuckDuckGo</u> (search engine), and other services which may be restricted locally or provide cause for 
concern on privacy/ad tracking (Lexie 2018). Residents in China employ it to bypass the ‘great firewall 
of China’ internet filter which prevents them from accessing many popular services. Journalists also 
use the dark web to write about politically sensitive content which may be punishable by the law of 
their country. Similarly, whistleblowers may communicate with journalists and leak sensitive data to 
have it published on the surface web, but fear for their safety (Chertoff and Simon 2015).

Cybercrime & Terrorism 
</h1>
<br> 
<p>

Cybercrime or terrorism on the dark web can be enacted by individuals or well-organised groups. 

Cybercrime is increasingly accessible to anyone who wishes to engage in low-risk criminal activities 
while still having an impact (e.g. conducting DDoS attacks on websites is as convenient as hiring a 
botnet which offers <u> DoS-as-a-Service</u> (Crawley 2016)).
